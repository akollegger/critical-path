## Scenario

As (pretend) [Jonah Goldberg](https://twitter.com/JonahNRO), I've noticed [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org) because 
my friend Andreas Kollegger has tweeted about it. Andreas is a smart guy, so I'm curious about what he's up to. 
While I'm no nerd, I do make my living on the internets and am well rounded enough to write critical political 
analysis steeped in pop culture references. 

**Goal**: understand what Neo4j is
