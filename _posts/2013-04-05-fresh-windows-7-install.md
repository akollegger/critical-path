- Immediately open Internet Explorer, browse to [neo4j.org](http://neo4j.org)
- Click download button
  - why doesn't the page know that I'm using IE and assume to offer me 1 
    large recommended download of the preferred version for my platform, 
    with a smaller option to see other downloads
- scan page, looking for Windows install. click the first one - Neo4j 1.9.M05
- wait for download
- open download folder
- right click "Extract all"
- click "Extract" button withoutchanging destination of choices
- double-click "neo4j-community-1.9.M05" to open that folder
- a bunch of files. ah, a readme. double-click that
  - Windows users may not be likely to read the readme
  - virus scan first
  - would expect some foo.exe to run, or an installer
- ignore readme, go back to website
- watch the video
  - different version of website
  - shows me how to download Neo4j, which I obviously did already to get here
  - this is for a mac. I just downloaded the windows version. Why does neo4j.org still 
    not know which platform I'm on?
  - weird. at the end of that, I then get a link to Neo4j installation on Windows 8
  - I'm on Windows 7
  - *sigh*
  - watching that
