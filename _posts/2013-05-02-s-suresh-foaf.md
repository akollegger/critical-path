Thanks Andreas.

 
1. Download Neo4j 1.9.RC2 for your platform 
  - <<Suresh>> Straight forward and easy
2. Unpack it 
  - <<Suresh>> Straight forward and easy
3. Run it 
  - <<Suresh>> Need not say it more...
4. Create a small social graph, with you and a few friends 
  - <Suresh>> Have played around with sample datasets. But yet to create a dataset on my own. I would appreciate help on those aspects. Also if I have my data in RDBMS or NoSQL DB (say mongoDB), how do I load data into graphDB.
5. Write a Cypher query which finds the friends of your friends
  - <Suresh>> Basic Cyper query is cool. I have tried few very very very basic queries to select few nodes. Need to explore further on this.

Thanks,
Suresh
