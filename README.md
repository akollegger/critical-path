# Critical Path

This is an exercise in continuous usability testing (CUT'ing?) of Neo4j, through repeated trials by (real or
impersonated) people with explicit goals, assumptions and constraints. The critical path leads from being completely
unaware of Neo4j to falling in love with Neo4j (committed to Neo4j as a non-optional dependency).

The path attempts to understand how a user relates to Neo4j as they traverse the traditional marketing/sales funnel.
